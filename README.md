Geophy Assignment:- I have automated the test cases using Selenium Web driver. 
Search Java file has the code for all test cases. I have created 3 test cases for the assignment.  
Test case SearchAll:- In this test case,user enters the search critriea as per the assignment and validates that valuation is displayed for the entered property critriea.
Test case SearchRequires:- In this test case, user enter all the mandatory serach fields and validates that valuation is displayed for the entered property critriea.
Test case MandatoryFieldEmpty:- In this test case,user doesn't enter all mandatory fileds and validates that Run Validation button is disbaled as Run Valuation button should only be enabled when all the mandatories fileds are filled in. 
I have created two private functions for opening and closing the chrome browser. Setup() opens a chrome browser and Teardown() closes a browser. 
I have used TestNG annotations for grouping the test cases. 
Search.xml file has the code to execute the test cases. 
TestExecutionReport doc file has screenshots of the TestNG Report.
